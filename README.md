# Class Update (Feb 25)

Fixed typo in PowerPoint slides and added OpenOffice/LibreOffice formatted slides with fewer animations that should work better with the classroom PCs. Fixed the example SVM R script.

# Class Update (Feb 24)

Updated slides, plus R code for RandomForest and PCA. The "swiss-roll" data set has also been added to the data folder.


# Class Update (Feb. 11)

*  Here's a nice article on selecting an appropriate *k* for k-means clustering using R: [https://www.r-bloggers.com/finding-optimal-number-of-clusters/](https://www.r-bloggers.com/finding-optimal-number-of-clusters/). I've also updated the R-code example in the repo with a new section showing one way to select *k* using the "elbow method."

*  Another nice article detailing how to run and interpret the output of linear regression in R (note many of the output statistics discussed are also provided by Weka): [http://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html](http://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html)


# Into to Machine Learning Algorithms

Part 1-3 Course Materials are now online. Today we will be running examples using Weka and RStudio (feel free to use one or both of these)

If you are using a classroom computer, please make sure you can open the programs.

If you are using your own laptop, please install one if you do not have it already:

* Weka (requires Java): [https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)
  + Launch from terminal where Weka is located with: `java -jar weka.jar`
* R (programming language): [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* RStudio Desktop: [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

NOTE: `.Rmd` files are [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) files and should be opened in RStudio rather than regular R. These are interactive notebook files similar to Jupyter notebooks for Python. If you're interested in learning more about RMarkdown I have slides from a previous class I've taught on it [available here](https://www.dveltri.com/NIEHS/rmarkdown/).
